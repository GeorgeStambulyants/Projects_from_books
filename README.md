# Projects From Books #

## Preface ##
Here I keep brief overviews of projects from books that I've read or read now.
Each overview includes the following sections:
* Short description of the book.
* Technologies that were used.
* What I have learned from the book.

This file is regularly updated. All finished books are marked.
